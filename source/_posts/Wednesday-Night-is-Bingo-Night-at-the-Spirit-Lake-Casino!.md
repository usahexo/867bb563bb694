#  Wednesday Night is Bingo Night at the Spirit Lake Casino!

Every Wednesday night, the Spirit Lake Casino in St. Michael, North Dakota is alive with the sound of Bingo! The casino offers three sessions of Bingo every Wednesday night: 6:00pm, 7:30pm, and 10:00pm.

Session 1 at 6:00pm usually has the smallest crowd, so if you're looking for a more intimate Bingo experience, this is the session for you! Plus, it's free to play Bingo during Session 1.

Session 2 at 7:30pm is the most popular session because it's right before the casino's free buffet. Be sure to come hungry, because the buffet features all your favorite American dishes like fried chicken, ham and beans, and apple pie.

Session 3 at 10:00pm is also popular because it's the last session of the night and gives bingo players plenty of time to hit the slots or casino floor after playing Bingo.

No matter what session you choose to attend, Wednesdays at the Spirit Lake Casino are always a blast!
