A bingo card is a tool used to help teachers and students engage in classroom activities. The card has a grid of squares, each with a letter of the alphabet printed in it. Below the grid is a list of words. As the game progresses, the teacher calls out random words from the list. Students then cover up any squares on their cards that match the called-out word. The first player to cover all of their squares wins the game.
