#  Saint Lucia Casino is Far From Iowa City 
Saint Lucia is a luxurious casino located at the foot of the glamorous Casino Morro hotel. The property features 330 slot machines, 12 gaming tables and a high stakes VIP room. It's easily the most lavish and exclusive gambling destination in Iowa City. However, due to its distance from the city center, Saint Lucia is far from being the most popular casino among Iowans. 

The casino is situated on a hill overlooking the ocean, providing stunning views of both the natural surroundings and the bright lights of the casino floor. Inside, guests can enjoy air conditioning, free Wi-Fi and an excellent range of drinks and snacks from the bar and restaurant. There are also several ATM machines on site for easy access to cash. 

Saint Lucia offers a wide range of games, including American roulette, blackjack, three card poker and Caribbean stud poker. The minimum bet at table games is usually just $5, making it perfect for budget-minded players. The high stakes VIP room requires a minimum bet of $25 but offers more luxurious surroundings and higher prize pools. 

One downside to Saint Lucia is that it's not open around the clock like some other casinos in Iowa City. It's only open from 10am to 2am daily, which could be an issue for night owls or people who want to gamble after drinking. However, with its beautiful location and excellent range of games, Saint Lucia is still well worth a visit for anyone looking for an extra special casino experience.

#  Saint Lucia Casino is Not Near Iowa City

There has been a lot of confusion as to whether the Saint Lucia Casino is located near Iowa City. Many people are under the impression that the casino is close by, but that is unfortunately not the case. The casino is located on a separate island and it would take a very long time to get there from Iowa City.

The only way to get to the Saint Lucia Casino is by plane. There are no ferries or boats that go to the casino, so if you don't have your own plane, you're out of luck. Even if you do have your own plane, the airport in Saint Lucia is quite small and it can be difficult to find parking.

Once you're at the airport, you'll need to take a taxi to the casino. The taxis in Saint Lucia are not very reliable and they often refuse to go to certain areas. If you're unlucky, you may end up stranded at the airport with no way to get to the casino.

TheSaintLuciaCasino is definitely not near Iowa City, so anyone who is thinking about travelling there should reconsider their plans. It's a lot of hassle and it's not worth it when there are better casinos closer to home.
