#  How to Play Port Machine Bingo

Port Machine is a game that can be played by any number of people, and the object of the game is to be the first player to mark off all five of their numbers on their Bingo card. The game can be played with standard Bingo cards, or with cards that have been specially printed with Port Machine symbols instead of the traditional Bingo numbers.

The game begins by dealing each player a card, and then one card is placed in the middle of the table face-up. The remainder of the deck is placed face-down next to the face-up card. The player who draws the card from the deck then begins play by flipping over the top card. The player to their left then flips over the next card, and so on. If a player flips over a symbol that matches one on their card, they place a chip or marker on that symbol.

When a player has filled up a row on their card, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, they call out "Bingo!" and are declared the winner. If two or more players have filled up a row on their cards at the same time, then the first player to shout "Bingo!" is declared the winner.

If all five symbols are drawn before anyone has won, then another round is played using the same setup as before. The player who flips over the first card in this round begins play as usual.
