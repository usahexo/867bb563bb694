#  Lions Bettors Hit Hard After Tough Season

It was a tough year for Detroit Lions bettors. The team made it to the playoffs, but lost in the first round. That’s little consolation for fans who are now looking at a losing season from a betting perspective.

The Lions started off the season strong, going 5-1 in their first six games. However, they went just 2-6 the rest of the way, including that playoff loss. Bettors who backed Detroit early on got burned as they missed out on some big potential payouts.

Detroit was one of the most popular teams to bet on this year. The Lions had an over/under win total of 9.5 and around 60% of bets were placed on the over. With Detroit only winning six games, it’s clear that many bettors were expecting more from this team.

There were some bright spots for Detroit this year. Quarterback Matthew Stafford had an MVP-caliber season, throwing for over 4,600 yards and 41 touchdowns. Wide receiver Kenny Golladay also emerged as a star, with 1,063 receiving yards and nine touchdowns.

However, these individual performances weren’t enough to lead the Lions to victory in most games. Injuries also played a role in Detroit’s struggles down the stretch, as several key players were sidelined late in the season.

Looking ahead to next year, many Lions fans will be hoping for a better result from their team. Stafford is still under contract and should be back next year, along with most of Detroit’s other starters. There are some key free agents that the team will need to address this offseason, including defensive end Ezekiel Ansah and cornerback Nevin Lawson.

If Ansah can be re-signed and healthy next year, he could help anchor a defense that was ranked 21st in sacks this season. The Lions will also need to find a new running back to replace LeGarrette Blount, who is set to become a free agent this offseason.

Overall, there is plenty of potential for improvement for Detroit next year. If they can stay healthy and play up to their potential, they could be one of the top teams in the NFC North Division. Bettors who stick with the Lions should be in good shape heading into next season

#  Oklahoma Sports Betting Booming Ahead of Lions' Playoff Game

It's only natural that as the Detroit Lions head to Oklahoma to take on the red-hot, No. 1 seed in the NFC Playoffs, sports betting is booming in the Sooner State.

Oklahoma sportsbooks have taken in nearly $2 million worth of bets on NFL games this season, with over 60 percent of that money wagered on Sunday and Monday night games, according to figures from the state's gaming commission.

And that doesn't include any prop bets or parlay cards being offered on the game between the Lions and the Sooners.

"There's a lot of money at stake," said Jay Kornegay, vice president of race and sports for Caesars Entertainment, which operates four casinos in Oklahoma. "They're definitely taking it serious."

The Caesars casino in Tulsa has seen the biggest handle on NFL games this season at just over $1 million. The other three casinos are seeing bet volume ranging from $425,000 to $570,000.

The game between Detroit and Oklahoma is getting a lot of attention not only because of the playoff implications, but also because of Heisman Trophy winner Baker Mayfield leading the Sooners against another high-profile quarterback in Matthew Stafford of the Lions.

Stafford is no stranger to big games in Oklahoma. He led Georgia to victory over Alabama in the SEC Championship Game at Cowboys Stadium in Arlington, Texas, while he was attending college. That game drew nearly $15 million worth of bets at Nevada sportsbooks.

#  Detroit Lions Fans Will Be Betting on Themselves This Weekend

The Detroit Lions have not had the best season so far. They are currently 3-5 and they are in third place in their division. This is not where they want to be, but they still have a chance to make it to the playoffs. If they can win their next three games, they will be in a good position to qualify for the post season.

The first game that the Lions need to win is this weekend against the Cleveland Browns. The Browns are one of the worst teams in the NFL, so this should be an easy win for Detroit. The second game is against the Chicago Bears, who are also a weak team. The Lions should be able to beat them as well.

The final game of the regular season is against the Green Bay Packers. This will be a more difficult game for Detroit, but they can still win if they play well. If they lose this game, it is not necessarily the end of the world. They could still make it to the playoffs as a wild card team.

So, Detroit Lions fans will be betting on themselves this weekend. They can still make it to the playoffs if they win their next three games. It will not be easy, but it is definitely possible.
