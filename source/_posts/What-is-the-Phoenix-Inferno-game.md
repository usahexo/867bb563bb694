#  What is the Phoenix Inferno game?

The Phoenix Inferno game is a new and exciting online casino game that has taken the world by storm. The game is based on a simple concept – you are trying to win as much money as possible by betting on the colour of a playing card. If you choose correctly, your payout will be doubled; but if you choose incorrectly, you will lose your entire bet.

The Phoenix Inferno game is available at a number of leading online casinos, including CasinoTop10. It can be played for real money or for free, so you can practice until you are confident enough to start betting for real.

# How to play the game
