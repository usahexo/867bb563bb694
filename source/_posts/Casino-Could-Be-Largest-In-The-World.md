Casino Could Be Largest In The World
The Cotai Strip in Macau is already home to some of the largest casinos in the world, but a new development could see one casino dwarf them all. The property, owned by Galaxy Entertainment Group, is set to open in 2020 and will be twice the size of the Venetian Macao.

The new casino will have a total floor space of 15.3 million square feet, making it the largest casino in the world. It will also have 5,000 hotel rooms and 1.2 million square feet of retail space.

The project has been given the green light by the government of Macau and is expected to create around 30,000 jobs. It's also likely to bring in more tourists, as it will be conveniently located near Macau's airport.

Galaxy Entertainment Group is no stranger to big casinos. The company already operates several of the largest properties on the Cotai Strip, including Galaxy Macau, StarWorld Macau, and Parisian Macau.

The opening of this new casino is sure to heat up competition among casino operators in Macau. Wynn Resorts and Las Vegas Sands are two companies that are likely to feel the heat as they both have large casinos on the Cotai Strip.

#  Cruise Ship Casino Could House More Than 3,000 Slot Machines 

If all goes as planned, a cruise ship casino could soon be docked in Miami, giving tourists and locals alike the opportunity to try their luck on more than 3,000 slot machines.

The casino would be part of the larger $4 billion expansion project that the Genting Group, a Malaysian company, has planned for its Resorts World Miami property. The massive development would include a hotel, convention center, and retail and dining space in addition to the casino.

Renderings of the proposed development show a sleek, modern structure with an enormous glass facade. The casino would have plenty of room for gaming tables and slot machines, as well as private VIP gambling rooms.

Genting Group already has three casino resorts in Florida - in Palm Beach Gardens, Broward County, and Miami - but this would be its largest project to date. The group has been working on the Resorts World Miami development for several years now, but faced some setbacks last year when its original plans were rejected by local officials.

In response to those objections, Genting Group went back to the drawing board and came up with a revised proposal that is now being considered by city officials. If everything goes according to plan, construction on the casino could begin as early as this year and it could be open for business by 2020.

Casinos are big business in Florida; in 2016 alone, they generated more than $2.5 billion in revenue from gambling taxes and fees. With so much money at stake, it's no surprise that developers are eager to get a piece of the action. In addition to Genting Group's planned development, there are also two other casino projects in the works for Miami - one by Las Vegas Sands Corporation and another by Hard Rock International.

While some residents have expressed concerns about added traffic and noise from these new casinos, others see them as an opportunity to bring jobs and tourism dollars to the area. There is no doubt that they will be a major draw for visitors; according to industry experts, casinos can generate up to four times as much revenue as other types of tourist attractions.

So far there has been no official word on whether Genting Group's proposed cruise ship casino will be approved or not, but it looks like there is a good chance that it will happen eventually. If you're looking for some excitement while you're in Miami - or if you just want to try your luck at beating the house - then this is definitely something worth keeping an eye on.

#  New Cruise Ship Casino Could Offer More Than $1 Billion In Jackpots

The new cruise ship casino is expected to offer more than $1 billion in jackpots, making it one of the world's most lucrative gambling destinations. Operators are hoping that the new casino will draw in tourists from all over the world, boosting the tourism industry and bringing in much-needed revenue.

The new casino will feature a wide variety of slots and table games, as well as a number of exclusive VIP rooms for high-rollers. There will also be a number of restaurants and bars, as well as a luxury spa and swimming pool.

The ship itself is an impressive sight, with its sleek design and modern amenities. It can accommodate up to 4,000 passengers, making it one of the largest cruise ships in the world.

The casino is set to open in 2020 and is already causing a buzz among gambling enthusiasts. With its massive jackpots and luxurious amenities, it is sure to be a popular destination for those looking for a unique gaming experience.
