<p>Republican Rep. Holly Rehder, who is sponsoring the bill, says the measure would help boost tourism. The bill has been met with mixed reactions, with some arguing that it would create a two-tiered system in which casino gambling is only allowed in certain areas of the state.</p>
<p>Opponents also argue that the proposal would not actually generate more tourism but would simply divert money from other casinos located in Missouri.</p>
<p>Rehder, however, counters that argument by saying her proposal would make it easier for people to access casinos and that it would create jobs. She also dismissed concerns that the proposal would create a two-tier system, saying that “the good Lord didn’t put every good thing on top of the hill.”</p>
<h1 id="Bill-Restricts-Gambling-to-Rivers-in-Iowa"><a href="#Bill-Restricts-Gambling-to-Rivers-in-Iowa" class="headerlink" title="Bill Restricts Gambling to Rivers in Iowa"></a>Bill Restricts Gambling to Rivers in Iowa</h1><p>On Tuesday, Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds signed a bill into law that prohibits gambling on games other than the lottery and horse racing at casinos, tracks, and clubs in the state.</p>
<p>The new legislation, Senate File 2275, clarifies that slot machines and other casino games are only legal on the premises of licensed horse racing tracks. The bill passed the Iowa Senate by a vote of 36-12 and the Iowa House by a vote of 78-21.</p>
<p>Governor Reynolds commented on the passage of the bill, saying “This is about keeping Iowans safe and ensuring that riverboat casinos are focused on their primary mission - providing a family-friendly environment for entertainment and tourism.”</p>
<p>Iowa has twelve casinos that offer slots and table games. Under the new law, these casinos will be allowed to continue offering these games, but will not be able to expand their operations or offer any new types of gambling.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-Moves-to-Rivers-as-Council-Considers-New-Legislation"><a href="#Gambling-Moves-to-Rivers-as-Council-Considers-New-Legislation" class="headerlink" title="Gambling Moves to Rivers as Council Considers New Legislation"></a>Gambling Moves to Rivers as Council Considers New Legislation</h1><p>Casinos have been a staple of the Las Vegas strip for many years, but this could be changing in the near future. The LVCVA is eyeing new locations for casinos, with the hope of expanding into other states. One such location is the riverfront, a move that has some council members up in arms.</p>
<p>The main concern seems to be that having casinos on the riverfront will take away from the natural beauty of the area. Some fear that it will also lead to an increase in crime and prostitution. Others are more worried about the negative economic impact that casinos can have on a community.</p>
<p>One supporter of the proposed legislation is Councilman Bob Beers. He believes that casinos can be a great source of revenue for the city, and that they will bring in much-needed jobs. He also believes that they will help to attract tourism to the area.</p>
<p>Councilwoman Lois Tarkanian is opposed to the legislation, arguing that it could hurt small businesses in the area. She also fears that it will lead to an increase in crime rates and social problems.</p>
<p>The issue is sure to generate a lot of debate, but it looks like gambling may soon be moving to rivers across America.</p>
<h1 id="Proposal-Would-Limit-Gambling-to-Rivers-in-Iowa"><a href="#Proposal-Would-Limit-Gambling-to-Rivers-in-Iowa" class="headerlink" title="Proposal Would Limit Gambling to Rivers in Iowa"></a>Proposal Would Limit Gambling to Rivers in Iowa</h1><p>DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) - Gambling would be limited to rivers in Iowa under a proposal advanced Tuesday by the Senate Appropriations Committee.</p>
<p>The bill would prohibit gambling on any land other than the state’s riverbeds. Sen. Jeff Danielson, D-Cedar Falls, said the idea is to protect Iowans from casinos popping up next to their homes.</p>
<p>“If we’re going to have gambling in the state of Iowa, it ought to be confined to a specific area,” Danielson said.</p>
<p>The amendment was added to a bill that allows gambling on cruise boats traveling on Iowa’s waterways. The amendment doesn’t address whether gambling would be allowed online or at racetracks.</p>
<p>Gambling supporters say the amendment could doom the entire bill. Rep. Bobby Kaufmann, R-Wilton, warned that it would create a “black market” for gambling and cost the state jobs and revenue.</p>
<p>The committee voted 10-7 to send the amended bill to the full Senate for debate.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-Only-Allowed-on-Rivers-If-This-Bill-Passes"><a href="#Gambling-Only-Allowed-on-Rivers-If-This-Bill-Passes" class="headerlink" title="Gambling Only Allowed on Rivers If This Bill Passes"></a>Gambling Only Allowed on Rivers If This Bill Passes</h1><p>Gambling would only be legal on rivers in the state of Washington if a new bill proposed by two state lawmakers is passed.</p>
<p>Reps. Cary Condotta, R-East Wenatchee, and Jeff Holy, R-Spokane, have jointly introduced House Bill 2164, which would make it legal for gambling to take place only on the state’s rivers and would outlaw all other forms of gambling.</p>
<p>The goal of the proposed bill is to help boost tourism in the state by catering to those who enjoy fishing and gambling.</p>
<p>“We have a lot of people who come up here and like to do both things – fish and gamble,” said Holy.</p>
<p>Under the proposed bill, only licensed casinos could offer gambling services on the state’s rivers. The measure would also establish a fund that would be used to support programs that promote responsible gaming.</p>
<p>Reps. Condotta and Holy believe that House Bill 2164 has a good chance of passing, as there is already bipartisan support for it.</p>
<p>“I think it has a pretty fair chance of passing because there is some appeal to it obviously for people in eastern Washington who want to do some fishing and also maybe engage in some light gambling as they are doing that,” said Condotta.</p>
<p>Those in opposition to the bill argue that it could lead to more problems with gambling addiction. However, Rep. Holy believes that this type of legislation can help address such issues.</p>
<p>“I think this gives us an opportunity to really focus on those issues and make sure that we have appropriate controls in place so that people can do it in a safe way and hopefully avoid some of those negative impacts,” said Holy.</p>
