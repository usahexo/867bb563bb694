        <h1 id="State-Gambling-Ages-Vary-In-The-US-But-Is-There-A-Federal-One"><a href="#State-Gambling-Ages-Vary-In-The-US-But-Is-There-A-Federal-One" class="headerlink" title="State Gambling Ages Vary In The US, But Is There A Federal One?"></a>State Gambling Ages Vary In The US, But Is There A Federal One?</h1><p>State gambling ages vary around the US, with some states allowing gambling at 18 and others setting the minimum age at 21. So, is there a federal minimum gambling age?</p>
<p>The answer is complicated. There is no specific federal law that dictates a minimum gambling age, but several laws do address the issue in different ways. The main federal law that applies to gambling is the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, which sets the minimum gambling age at 18 for activities on Native American reservations. However, this law does not apply to state-run lotteries or to casinos located in other states.</p>
<p>Several other federal laws deal with underage gambling in different ways. The Federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA) prohibits the sale of lottery tickets to anyone under 18, while the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act (UIGEA) prohibits banks and other financial institutions from processing payments for online gambling transactions by anyone under 21.</p>
<p>So, while there is no specific federal minimum age for gambling, there are a variety of laws that address the issue in different ways. Ultimately, it’s up to each individual state to decide what the minimum age for gambling should be.</p>
<h1 id="What-Is-The-Legal-Gambling-Age-In-The-USA"><a href="#What-Is-The-Legal-Gambling-Age-In-The-USA" class="headerlink" title="What Is The Legal Gambling Age In The USA?"></a>What Is The Legal Gambling Age In The USA?</h1><p>It seems like every day there’s a new gambling site or app on the internet. And, while many of these are strictly for entertainment purposes, an increasing number of them offer the potential to win real money. But what happens if you’re not old enough to gamble? Is there a legal gambling age in the USA?</p>
<p>The answer, unfortunately, is somewhat complicated. There is no federal law that sets a legal gambling age in the USA. This means that it’s up to each individual state to decide what the legal gambling age should be.</p>
<p>As of now, there are only six states where the legal gambling age is 21 years or older: Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana, Michigan, and South Dakota. The remaining 44 states have a legal gambling age of 18 or 19 years old.</p>
<p>There are some exceptions to this rule. For example, in New Jersey and Nevada – both of which have legal gambling ages of 21 years old – minors are allowed to play casino games as long as they are accompanied by an adult.</p>
<p>So, if you’re planning on betting on the Super Bowl this year and you’re not yet 21 years old, your best bet is to head to Nevada or New Jersey. Alternatively, you could wait until you turn 21 and gamble in one of the six states where the legal gambling age is higher than 18 years old.</p>
<h1 id="Who-Sets-The-Gambling-Age-In-America"><a href="#Who-Sets-The-Gambling-Age-In-America" class="headerlink" title="Who Sets The Gambling Age In America?"></a>Who Sets The Gambling Age In America?</h1><p>The gambling age in America is set at 18 by the federal government. This is mandated by the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006, which made it illegal for gambling businesses to knowingly accept payments in connection with the participation of any person under 18 in illegal gambling activities.</p>
<p>States are allowed to set their own gambling ages, and some have chosen to raise the age above 18. Utah, for example, has a gambling age of 21. But even in states with a higher gambling age, federal law trumps state law, so 18 is still the legal age everywhere in America.</p>
<p>There have been attempts to change the federal minimum age for gambling, but they have all failed. One reason for this may be that there is not much evidence that raising the age does anything to reduce underage gambling. A study by the National Opinion Research Center found that only 4% of youth who gambled did so illegally, so increasing the legal age would have little impact on overall rates of underage gambling.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, many people feel that 18 is too young an age to be allowed to gamble. They argue that young people lack the maturity and experience to make informed decisions about whether or not to gamble, and that they are more likely to develop problems with gambling addiction at an early age.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there are those who believe that 18 is a perfectly appropriate age to gamble legally. They argue that adults should be able to make their own choices about whether or not to gamble, and that prohibition does more harm than good by pushing gambling underground where it is less regulated and potentially more dangerous.</p>
<p>So who is right? That’s a complicated question for which there is no easy answer. The bottom line is that the legal gambling age in America is 18, and it’s unlikely to change anytime soon.</p>
<h1 id="How-Does-Gambling-Age-Compare-Between-States"><a href="#How-Does-Gambling-Age-Compare-Between-States" class="headerlink" title="How Does Gambling Age Compare Between States?"></a>How Does Gambling Age Compare Between States?</h1><p>There is no universal gambling age in the United States. The minimum gambling age range from 18 to 21 years old, depending on the state. There are six states that have a minimum gambling age of 21: Alaska, Arizona, Delaware, Idaho, Nebraska and Nevada. There are fifteen states that have a minimum gambling age of 18: Alabama, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Montana and New Hampshire.</p>
<p>The remaining twenty-four states have a minimum gambling age that ranges from 19 to 20 years old. A number of these states’ laws do not specify an exact age but leave it up to the discretion of casino or gaming commission employees to decide whether or not someone is old enough to gamble. This can be problematic as different casinos within the same state may have different policies regarding what they consider to be the appropriate gambling age. </p>
<p>It can also be difficult for parents or legal guardians of minors who want them to participate in legal forms of gambling like state lotteries because there is no definitive answer as to what the appropriate age is in every state. There are cases where one parent might be okay with their child gambling at a certain casino at the age of 19 but another parent might not be comfortable with their child doing so until they reach the age of 21. </p>
<p>One thing that all six states with a minimum gambling age of 21 have in common is that they all allow some form of casino gambling. Five out of six states with a minimum gambling age of 21 allow both commercial and tribal casinos while only Nebraska prohibits tribal casinos specifically. Most states with a minimum gambling age of 18 also allow commercial casinos but there are some exceptions. Mississippi only allows commercial casinos while Colorado and Kansas only allow tribal casinos. </p>
<p>There are also differences when it comes to other forms of legalized gambling like lotteries and horse racing. For example, Maine doesn’t have any form of casino gambling but does offer lottery games while Montana has both commercial and tribal casinos but doesn’t offer any form of lottery games. </p>
<p>It can be difficult for parents or legal guardians of minors who want them to participate in legal forms of gambling like state lotteries because there is no definitive answer as to what the appropriate age is in every state</p>
<h1 id="US-Casino-Gaming-Laws-Age-Limits"><a href="#US-Casino-Gaming-Laws-Age-Limits" class="headerlink" title="US Casino Gaming Laws: Age Limits"></a>US Casino Gaming Laws: Age Limits</h1><p>Casino gaming laws in the United States vary from state to state. One common restriction across all states is the minimum age for casino gambling. The minimum age for casino gambling is usually either 18 or 21 years old. In some states, there are exceptions to the minimum age for casino gambling, such as for Native American casinos.</p>
<p>The following table provides a breakdown of the minimum age for casino gambling by state.</p>
