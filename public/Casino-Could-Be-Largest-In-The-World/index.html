        <h1 id="Casino-Could-Be-Largest-In-The-World"><a href="#Casino-Could-Be-Largest-In-The-World" class="headerlink" title="Casino Could Be Largest In The World"></a>Casino Could Be Largest In The World</h1><p>Casino Could Be Largest In The World<br>The Cotai Strip in Macau is already home to some of the largest casinos in the world, but a new development could see one casino dwarf them all. The property, owned by Galaxy Entertainment Group, is set to open in 2020 and will be twice the size of the Venetian Macao.</p>
<p>The new casino will have a total floor space of 15.3 million square feet, making it the largest casino in the world. It will also have 5,000 hotel rooms and 1.2 million square feet of retail space.</p>
<p>The project has been given the green light by the government of Macau and is expected to create around 30,000 jobs. It’s also likely to bring in more tourists, as it will be conveniently located near Macau’s airport.</p>
<p>Galaxy Entertainment Group is no stranger to big casinos. The company already operates several of the largest properties on the Cotai Strip, including Galaxy Macau, StarWorld Macau, and Parisian Macau.</p>
<p>The opening of this new casino is sure to heat up competition among casino operators in Macau. Wynn Resorts and Las Vegas Sands are two companies that are likely to feel the heat as they both have large casinos on the Cotai Strip.</p>
<h1 id="Casino-Could-Be-Largest-In-The-World-1"><a href="#Casino-Could-Be-Largest-In-The-World-1" class="headerlink" title="Casino Could Be Largest In The World"></a>Casino Could Be Largest In The World</h1><h1 id="Cruise-Ship-Casino-Could-House-More-Than-3-000-Slot-Machines"><a href="#Cruise-Ship-Casino-Could-House-More-Than-3-000-Slot-Machines" class="headerlink" title="Cruise Ship Casino Could House More Than 3,000 Slot Machines"></a>Cruise Ship Casino Could House More Than 3,000 Slot Machines</h1><p>If all goes as planned, a cruise ship casino could soon be docked in Miami, giving tourists and locals alike the opportunity to try their luck on more than 3,000 slot machines.</p>
<p>The casino would be part of the larger $4 billion expansion project that the Genting Group, a Malaysian company, has planned for its Resorts World Miami property. The massive development would include a hotel, convention center, and retail and dining space in addition to the casino.</p>
<p>Renderings of the proposed development show a sleek, modern structure with an enormous glass facade. The casino would have plenty of room for gaming tables and slot machines, as well as private VIP gambling rooms.</p>
<p>Genting Group already has three casino resorts in Florida - in Palm Beach Gardens, Broward County, and Miami - but this would be its largest project to date. The group has been working on the Resorts World Miami development for several years now, but faced some setbacks last year when its original plans were rejected by local officials.</p>
<p>In response to those objections, Genting Group went back to the drawing board and came up with a revised proposal that is now being considered by city officials. If everything goes according to plan, construction on the casino could begin as early as this year and it could be open for business by 2020.</p>
<p>Casinos are big business in Florida; in 2016 alone, they generated more than $2.5 billion in revenue from gambling taxes and fees. With so much money at stake, it’s no surprise that developers are eager to get a piece of the action. In addition to Genting Group’s planned development, there are also two other casino projects in the works for Miami - one by Las Vegas Sands Corporation and another by Hard Rock International.</p>
<p>While some residents have expressed concerns about added traffic and noise from these new casinos, others see them as an opportunity to bring jobs and tourism dollars to the area. There is no doubt that they will be a major draw for visitors; according to industry experts, casinos can generate up to four times as much revenue as other types of tourist attractions.</p>
<p>So far there has been no official word on whether Genting Group’s proposed cruise ship casino will be approved or not, but it looks like there is a good chance that it will happen eventually. If you’re looking for some excitement while you’re in Miami - or if you just want to try your luck at beating the house - then this is definitely something worth keeping an eye on.</p>
<h1 id="New-Cruise-Ship-Casino-Could-Offer-More-Than-1-Billion-In-Jackpots"><a href="#New-Cruise-Ship-Casino-Could-Offer-More-Than-1-Billion-In-Jackpots" class="headerlink" title="New Cruise Ship Casino Could Offer More Than $1 Billion In Jackpots"></a>New Cruise Ship Casino Could Offer More Than $1 Billion In Jackpots</h1><p>The new cruise ship casino is expected to offer more than $1 billion in jackpots, making it one of the world’s most lucrative gambling destinations. Operators are hoping that the new casino will draw in tourists from all over the world, boosting the tourism industry and bringing in much-needed revenue.</p>
<p>The new casino will feature a wide variety of slots and table games, as well as a number of exclusive VIP rooms for high-rollers. There will also be a number of restaurants and bars, as well as a luxury spa and swimming pool.</p>
<p>The ship itself is an impressive sight, with its sleek design and modern amenities. It can accommodate up to 4,000 passengers, making it one of the largest cruise ships in the world.</p>
<p>The casino is set to open in 2020 and is already causing a buzz among gambling enthusiasts. With its massive jackpots and luxurious amenities, it is sure to be a popular destination for those looking for a unique gaming experience.</p>
<h1 id="Mega-Casino-Coming-To-A-Cruise-Near-You"><a href="#Mega-Casino-Coming-To-A-Cruise-Near-You" class="headerlink" title="Mega-Casino Coming To A Cruise Near You"></a>Mega-Casino Coming To A Cruise Near You</h1><p>In a move that is sure to thrill cruise passengers and casino-goers alike, mega-casino operators MGM Resorts and Penn National Gaming have announced they are teaming up to bring the biggest and best gambling experience to cruise ships.</p>
<p>The partnership will see the two companies working together to create exclusive casino areas onboard select cruise ships, with all the bells and whistles players have come to expect from land-based casinos. These areas will offer a huge variety of table games and slot machines, as well as top-notch customer service.</p>
<p>According to MGM Resorts CEO Jim Murren, the new venture is all about “providing our guests with unforgettable experiences they can only find on a cruise”. He went on to say that the partnership with Penn National Gaming will “enable us to deliver an unparalleled gaming offering that will rival anything else in the market today”.</p>
<p>Penn National Gaming CEO Eric Schiffer echoed these sentiments, stating that his company is looking forward to collaborating with MGM Resorts “to create a world-class casino product that raises the bar for what is possible on a cruise ship”.</p>
<p>So far, only one cruise line has been confirmed as partnering with MGM Resorts and Penn National Gaming – Norwegian Cruise Line. The two companies are currently working together to create an all-new mega-casino area for Norwegian’s new Bliss ship, which is set to debut in 2019. The area will take up almost half of the ship’s casino deck and offer everything from blackjack and roulette tables to hundreds of state-of-the-art slot machines.</p>
<p>It’s not yet clear whether other cruise lines will join forces with MGM Resorts and Penn National Gaming in the future, but it seems likely that more announcements will be forthcoming in the coming months. In any case, this partnership is sure to shake up the cruise ship gambling scene, so stay tuned for more news!</p>

<p>There are also several restaurants and bars located in the casino, so passengers can grab a bite or drink while they enjoy a game.</p>
<p>The casino is sure to be popular with passengers on Royal Caribbean’s new Oasis of the Seas ship. The Oasis of the Seas is the largest cruise ship in the world, with a capacity of over 6,000 passengers.</p>
