<p>How to Play Blackjack</p>
<p>The goal of blackjack is to beat the dealer’s hand by either getting 21 points on your first two cards (called a “natural”), or by reaching a point total higher than the dealer without going over 21. To begin the game, each player is dealt two cards face-up. The dealer is then dealt two cards, one face-up and one face-down. Players must decide whether to “hit” (take another card), “stand” (end their turn), or “double down” (double their bet and receive one more card). After all players have finished their turns, the dealer flips over their hidden card and completes their hand. If the dealer has a point total of 16 or lower, they must take another card (“hit”). If the dealer has a point total of 17 or higher, they must stand. The player who has the highest point total wins the hand. If both player and dealer have the same point total, the hand is called a “push” and no money is exchanged.</p>
<p>Variations of Blackjack</p>
<p>Blackjack comes in many different variations, each with its own set of rules. Some popular variations include:</p>
<p>Double Down: In this variation, players are allowed to double their original bet after receiving their first two cards. They receive just one more card and then must stand. This can be a risky move but can also result in big payouts if played correctly!</p>

This can be a risky move but can also result in big payouts if played correctly! Split Pairs: In this variation, if you are dealt two cards of the same rank (e.g., two kings), you can split them into two separate hands by placing an additional bet equal to your original bet. You then play each hand separately, normally hitting as many times as you like until either you reach 21 or go bust. You can also double down on any two cards if you wish!</p>

Insurance: In this variation, when the dealer has an ace showing as their upcard, players are given the chance to buy insurance against the possibility of the dealer having a blackjack (a 10-point card). If the dealer does have a blackjack, players lose their insurance bets but win their original bets at even money (1:1). If the dealer does not have a blackjack, players lose both their insurance bets and original bets.</p>
