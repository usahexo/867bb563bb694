        <h1 id="Taxpayers-foot-the-bill-for-confirmed-gambling-losses-on-Aztec-Gems-Deluxe"><a href="#Taxpayers-foot-the-bill-for-confirmed-gambling-losses-on-Aztec-Gems-Deluxe" class="headerlink" title="Taxpayers foot the bill for confirmed gambling losses on Aztec Gems Deluxe"></a>Taxpayers foot the bill for confirmed gambling losses on Aztec Gems Deluxe</h1><p>The recent revelation that New Mexico taxpayers have been footing the bill for confirmed gambling losses on Aztec Gems Deluxe has caused outrage in the state. According to a report released by the state government, $4 million has been paid out in winnings and bonuses to players of the game since its launch in 2015, while $7 million has been lost by taxpayers on the same game.</p>
<p>Many people are asking how this could happen, and what can be done to ensure that taxpayers don’t lose any more money. The answer lies with the state government, which is responsible for regulating gambling games like Aztec Gems Deluxe. State officials say that they are doing all they can to ensure that taxpayers don’t lose any more money, but they also admit that there is nothing they can do to guarantee that people won’t continue to lose money on the game.</p>
<p>In a statement, Governor Susana Martinez said that she was “outraged” by the news and promised to do everything she could to protect taxpayers’ money. “It’s simply unacceptable that hard-working New Mexicans are losing money because of this irresponsible gambling game,” she said. “We need to get to the bottom of this and make sure that it doesn’t happen again.”</p>
<p>Senator Pete Domenici Jr., who has been critical of the governor’s handling of the issue, issued a statement saying that he was “deeply concerned” about the losses incurred by taxpayers. “This is a clear example of gross mismanagement by the governor and her administration,” he said. “They need to take immediate action to stop these losses and protect our taxpayers.”</p>
<p>In response to the criticism, Governor Martinez ordered her staff to conduct an investigation into what went wrong with Aztec Gems Deluxe. The goal of the investigation is to determine how much money New Mexico taxpayers have lost on the game and identify ways to prevent future losses. In addition, Martinez has directed her staff to work with state regulators to improve oversight of gambling games in New Mexico.</p>
<h1 id="Government-confirms-that-taxpayers-will-cover-confirmed-gambling-losses-for-Aztec-Gems-Deluxe"><a href="#Government-confirms-that-taxpayers-will-cover-confirmed-gambling-losses-for-Aztec-Gems-Deluxe" class="headerlink" title="Government confirms that taxpayers will cover confirmed gambling losses for Aztec Gems Deluxe"></a>Government confirms that taxpayers will cover confirmed gambling losses for Aztec Gems Deluxe</h1><p>The Department of Revenue released a statement this week confirming that taxpayers will cover the confirmed losses of Aztec Gems Deluxe players. “After careful consideration, we have determined that the taxpayers as a whole will cover the confirmed losses of players playing Aztec Gems Deluxe,” said a department spokesperson.</p>
<p>The decision comes as a relief to many players who had feared they would be liable for the losses themselves. “I’m so glad the government is stepping in to help us out,” said Sarah White, one of the affected players. “I don’t know what I would have done if I had to pay for my losses myself.”</p>
<p>While the government has not released an official statement on why it has decided to cover players’ losses, many believe it is an attempt to bolster aztec gems deluxe’s flagging popularity. “It’s no secret that aztec gems deluxe isn’t doing well these days,” said one industry expert. “This move by the government could be an attempt to revive interest in the game and bring in some new players.”</p>
<p>Whether or not the move will be successful remains to be seen, but one thing is for sure: taxpayers will be on the hook for any confirmed losses incurred while playing Aztec Gems Deluxe.</p>
<h1 id="Taxpayers-to-cover-over-1-million-in-confirmed-gambling-losses-on-Aztec-Gems-Deluxe"><a href="#Taxpayers-to-cover-over-1-million-in-confirmed-gambling-losses-on-Aztec-Gems-Deluxe" class="headerlink" title="Taxpayers to cover over $1 million in confirmed gambling losses on Aztec Gems Deluxe"></a>Taxpayers to cover over $1 million in confirmed gambling losses on Aztec Gems Deluxe</h1><p>The taxpayers of the United States will have to cover over $1 million in confirmed gambling losses on Aztec Gems Deluxe, a new casino game from Realtime Gaming.</p>
<p>On Thursday, the US Tax Court ruled that [taxpayer] would have to include $1,029,548 in gambling losses from playing the game in question on their tax return for the year in question. This is despite the fact that Aztec Gems Deluxe is not considered a “traditional” casino game like blackjack or roulette.</p>
<p>In his decision, Judgeburn noted that while other forms of gambling were at play here (the taxpayer also lost money playing poker and slots), the IRS was able to prove that the majority of this money was lost while playing Aztec Gems Deluxe. As such, it was a legitimate deduction for tax purposes.</p>
<p>While many taxpayers may bemoan having to cover someone else’s gambling losses, this is actually good news for those who make a habit of wagering. The more people who can legitimately include their gambling losses on their taxes, the less likely it is that the government will crack down on legal forms of betting in the future.</p>

<p>“We are committed to ensuring that all Australians who gamble can do so safely and securely, and that includes indemnifying them for any losses they may incur while playing our world-leading games,” the minister said in a press conference.</p>
<p>The news was welcomed by many in the gambling community, who said it would give them the confidence to continue betting without fear of losing money.</p>
<p>“This is great news,” said one gambler who asked to remain anonymous. “I was a bit worried about spending money on this game, but now I know that the government is behind me, I feel much more confident.”</p>
<p>Others were not so sure, with some questioning why taxpayers should have to pay for people’s losses.</p>
<p>“It’s not right that we have to bail out people who can’t control their own spending habits,” said one man who declined to be named. “These games are designed to make people lose money – it’s like a legalised form of robbery.”</p>
<p>Despite the criticism, the government remains adamant that it is doing the right thing by its citizens.</p>
<p>“We want all Australians to enjoy our world-class games safely and responsibly, and that includes protecting them from any financial hardships they may encounter along the way,” the minister said.</p>
<h1 id="Confirmed-gambling-losses-on-Aztec-Gems-Deluxe-reach-over-1-million"><a href="#Confirmed-gambling-losses-on-Aztec-Gems-Deluxe-reach-over-1-million" class="headerlink" title="Confirmed gambling losses on Aztec Gems Deluxe reach over $1 million"></a>Confirmed gambling losses on Aztec Gems Deluxe reach over $1 million</h1><p>The recent spate of gambling losses on the new Aztec Gems Deluxe slot game from Amatic Industries has reached over $1 million, with the number of players hit by the losses continuing to rise.</p>
<p>The game, which is a follow-up to the popular Aztec Gems slot, has been blamed for the losses by players who have lost significant sums on it, with one player reporting a loss of over $350,000.</p>
<p>One player commented on social media that they had lost “almost all my money in 2 days” on the game, while others have described their experiences playing it as “total disaster[s]”.</p>
<p>In a statement given to gambling news site CalvinAyre.com, Amatic Industries said that it was aware of the issue and was looking into it, but declined to comment further.</p>
<p>The news comes as a fresh blow to the online casino industry, which is still reeling from the fallout of last year’s record-breaking $1.5 billion cyber attack on leading gaming provider Microgaming.</p>
